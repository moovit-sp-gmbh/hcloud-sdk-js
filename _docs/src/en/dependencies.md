# Dependencies

We try to limit the production dependencies being used by this SDK as much as possible to avoid version mismachtes and security risks.\
Dependencies are being monitored by Githubs [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) to avoid the use of versions which have known security issues.

## Axios
We use axios as http(s) client over a native nodejs client to enable the use of this SDK in frontends like react, vue etc. on top of nodejs backends.
